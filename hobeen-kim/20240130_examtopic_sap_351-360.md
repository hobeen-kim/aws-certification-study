- A : If your resources span multiple Availability Zones (AZ) , then create one NAT gateway per AZ. This helps to avoid a single point of failure and zone data transfer charges. Data that's transferred between Amazon EC2 and Elastic Network Interfaces in the same AZ is free.

The charges depend on the data transfer rates for the Region.
