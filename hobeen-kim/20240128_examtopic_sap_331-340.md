- A. Implement cross-account backup with AWS Backup vaults in designated non-production accounts. This will allow the company to securely copy their backups to other accounts that are part of their organization for operational or security reasons1. 
- C. Implement AWS Backup Vault Lock in compliance mode. This will provide an additional layer of protection and immutability to the backup vaults, preventing any user (including the root user) or AWS from deleting or modifying the backups until the retention period is complete2. 
- E. Configure the backup frequency, lifecycle, and retention period to ensure that at least one backup always exists in the cold tier. This will help the company to avoid accidental or malicious deletion of backups by enforcing a minimum retention period and moving the backups to a lower-cost storage tier2.
