- A. Ensure the HPC cluster is launched within a single Availability Zone: This choice ensures that the EC2 instances in the cluster have low network latency and high bandwidth, as they are located within the same data center. 
- C. Select EC2 instance types with an Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) enabled: EFA is a network interface that provides low-latency, high-bandwidth communication between EC2 instances. By selecting instance types with EFA enabled, the cluster can benefit from improved inter-instance communication. 
- (틀린거) E vs F. Replace Amazon EFS with Amazon FSx for Lustre: Amazon FSx for Lustre is a high-performance file system optimized for HPC workloads. By using FSx for Lustre instead of Amazon EFS, the cluster can achieve better performance for the large number of shared files generated by the workload.
