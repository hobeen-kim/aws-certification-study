- B Question say " The EC2 instance also has an attached security group that allows access from all customer IP addresses." 
  - B say "Attach the security group with customer IP addresses to the new endpoint"
- Option B suggests disassociating the Elastic IP address from the EC2 instance and creating an Amazon S3 bucket for SFTP file hosting. An AWS Transfer Family server is then created and configured with a VPC-hosted, internet-facing endpoint. The SFTP Elastic IP address is associated with the new endpoint, and the security group with customer IP addresses is attached to the endpoint. The Transfer Family server is pointed to the S3 bucket, and all files from the SFTP server are synced to the S3 bucket.
